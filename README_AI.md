This is an AI app that uses the Fiber EVM chain as a backend.

The Fiber EVM chain has very low latency and 0 gas fees, which enables to build full backend functionality entirely onchain with contracts and interactions with those contracts.

It uses the Foundry framework to deploy the contracts.

It uses the Next.js framework to create the frontend.

It uses the Tailwind CSS framework to style the frontend.

It uses the TypeScript programming language to write the code.

Whenever you need to add/modify contracts, make sure to add them to the DeployAll script and deploy them using the Makefile. Then you need to make sure to update the app with the new contract addresses.
